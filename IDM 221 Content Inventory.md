#### About Me
I am a Pre-Junior Interactive Digital Media Major at Drexel. I am from Norristown Pennsylvania which is about 5 minutes away from the King of Prussia Mall. I originally came to Drexel as a Computer Science major and actually went on a COOP at a company called Thermo Fisher Scientific where I was a Software Developer and I worked on debugging and developing a mobile application that ran on iOS, Android, and Windows Tablets.

I then switched majors to Interactive Digital Media during the Summer 2016 quarter after having a rough time with Computer Science and then ultimately realizing that it didn't offer the things that I wanted to do as a career, such as design work. When I graduate from Drexel I want to either work for a corporation or a design agency and have my work be based around UI/UX Design. 

When I am not studying or doing schoolwork I have a couple of hobbies. I like going out and exploring the city and taking photos with my DSLR(Canon T6i). Usually my photos consist of landscapes and buildings in the city, and whenever I'm outside the city I'll take nature photos. Also enjoy powerlifting as a hobby. Originally I just worked out to remain fit but then I discovered powerlifting and got hooked on it and now I'm looking to compete sometime next year. I would have competed sooner but injuries have plagued my chances at competing this year.

Whenever I'm bored and on my computer I like browsing Reddit and watching youtube videos but there is nothing really special about that. I enjoy listening to almost all genres of music except country, and lately I've been getting more into Jazz and calm sounding music. In the past I've always been a kind of music listener that enjoys the hard hitting beats and instrumentals of Rock and Metal but lately I've enjoyed listening to Jazz while studying and working on assignments.

That's pretty much everything about me.
