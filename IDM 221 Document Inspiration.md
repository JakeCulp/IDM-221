#### Uncrate.com
I like how Uncrate presents its content to the user. They use the majority of the space on the page but I never feel like I can focus on the content because there is so much there. Also like how when you scroll down a little the navigation bar changes and becomes fixed to the top of the page so that is with you as you scroll lower on the page. I also like how the site has a simple color scheme and instead uses more vibrant colors in its content such that I become attracted to the products and experiences they are showcasing.

#### Unsplash.com
Also similar to Uncrate, Unsplash puts the content first when you visit the site. All of the photos are huge and take up the whole page which is awesome because it gives you an idea on how you could use them for your own needs. And when you click on the photo you get a full screen preview of the photo plus in the bottom right corner there is an info button which will display data about the photo like what camera and lens it was shot on, which is extremely useful for me when I am in the market for a new lens for my DSLR.  

#### Overcast.fm
Sometimes I like to listen to podcasts while doing homework on my computer and Overcast allows for me to not have to open up a another application like itunes to listen to a podcast. The only thing I wish they could do to improve on their audio player would be to change their skimming intervals to 15 seconds instead of 30 seconds because a lot can occur within 30 seconds and its just inconvenient to have to wait a little bit of extra time to get to a certain point in the podcast. However you can change the speed that the podcast is played so you can cut down on this wait time.
